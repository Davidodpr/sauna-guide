# 7 Sauna Mistakes Everyone Makes (And One That Could Kill You)

Last week, I watched a guy walk into my gym's sauna wearing a full cotton tracksuit, AirPods in, protein shake in hand. He lasted about four minutes before stumbling out looking like he'd just run a marathon in a rainforest.

We've all been there. Maybe not the tracksuit, but definitely the "I'll figure this out as I go" approach to sauna use. And while most mistakes just make you uncomfortable (or get you silently judged by Finnish people), some can genuinely put you in danger.

Let's break down the mistakes that'll ruin your session, the ones that'll get you side-eyed by regulars, and yes, the one that could actually kill you.

## The Dangerous Stuff (Read This First)

Before we get to the funny stuff, let's talk about the mistakes that send people to emergency rooms. These aren't exaggerations.

### Mistake #1: Treating the Sauna Like an Endurance Contest

Here's a number that should scare you: **you lose up to one pint of sweat every 15 minutes** in a traditional sauna. That's not a typo. One pint. Every fifteen minutes.

Your body is literally pouring fluid out of every pore, and your blood is thickening while your heart works harder to circulate it. Most healthy adults can handle 15-20 minutes just fine. But the guy who stays in for 45 minutes because he wants to "really feel it"? He's playing Russian roulette with heatstroke.

**The Fix:** Start with 10-15 minute sessions. Work your way up to 20 minutes maximum. If you want longer heat exposure, take breaks. Step out, cool down for 5-10 minutes, then go back in. The benefits don't increase linearly with time, but the risks absolutely do.

### Mistake #2: The Alcohol Combo (Despite What the Movies Show)

Every "sophisticated" movie scene shows someone sipping whiskey in a sauna or hot tub. It looks cool. It's also incredibly stupid.

Alcohol dilates your blood vessels. So does heat. Combine them, and your blood pressure can drop so fast you pass out. Now you're unconscious in a 180-degree room. People have died this way. Not "gotten uncomfortable." Died.

**The Fix:** Save the drinks for after. Way after. At least an hour after your session, once you've rehydrated and your body temperature has normalized. Your celebratory beer will taste better anyway.

### Mistake #3: Ignoring Your Body's Warning Signals

Dizziness, nausea, rapid heartbeat, confusion, headache, muscle cramps. These aren't signs that "it's working." These are your body screaming at you to get out.

Heat exhaustion can progress to heat stroke within minutes. And heat stroke can cause brain damage or death. This isn't fear-mongering. It's biology.

**The Fix:** Leave immediately if you feel any of these symptoms. Sit or lie down in a cool area. Drink water. If symptoms persist for more than 15-20 minutes, or if you or someone else becomes confused or loses consciousness, that's a medical emergency.

### Mistake #4: Ignoring Medical Conditions

Saunas are incredible for cardiovascular health, but that assumes your cardiovascular system is already in decent shape. If you have:

- Uncontrolled high blood pressure
- Recent heart attack or stroke
- Unstable angina
- Severe aortic stenosis
- Pregnancy (especially first trimester)

...you need to talk to a doctor before using a sauna. This isn't optional caution. It's common sense.

**The Fix:** Get cleared by your doctor. Many people with heart conditions CAN use saunas safely, but they need appropriate guidance on temperature and duration.

## The Rookie Errors

Alright, enough doom and gloom. Let's talk about the mistakes that won't kill you, but will make your experience worse (and possibly make regulars question your life choices).

### Mistake #5: Starting at "Veteran" Temperatures

You walk in, see the thermometer at 175F (80C), and think "that's for beginners." So you crank it to 200F (93C) because you're tough.

Congratulations. You've just ensured you'll be stumbling out in 7 minutes feeling like garbage, while the "beginner" at 175F is still enjoying their session 15 minutes later.

**The Fix:** Your first few sessions should be at moderate temperatures (150-170F / 65-75C). Let your body adapt over 2-3 weeks before pushing higher. Finnish people who use 200F+ saunas have been doing this since childhood. You haven't.

### Mistake #6: Skipping the Pre-Sauna Shower

I know what you're thinking: "I'm about to sweat anyway, why shower first?"

Here's why: You're about to marinate in your own... everything. That layer of dead skin, body oils, deodorant residue, and whatever else is on your skin? When you heat up, it doesn't magically disappear. It just heats up WITH you. And in a public sauna, you're sharing that experience with everyone.

In Finland, skipping the pre-sauna shower is basically a war crime. And they're right.

**The Fix:** Quick shower. Soap. Rinse off the day before you cook in it. Your skin will sweat more efficiently, and you won't be "that person."

### Mistake #7: Metal Jewelry, Electronics, and Other Regrettable Choices

Let me paint you a picture: It's minute three. You're relaxing. Then suddenly your necklace becomes a tiny branding iron against your chest. Or your wedding ring starts feeling like it's been sitting on a stove burner.

Metal conducts heat. Really, really well. This isn't advanced physics. Yet somehow, every week I see someone ripping off jewelry with a look of profound regret.

And your phone? Your AirPods? They didn't sign up for this. Electronics are designed to work up to about 95F (35C). You're about to expose them to twice that. Heat destroys batteries, warps plastic, and turns your $250 headphones into modern art.

**The Fix:** Everything comes off before you go in. Watch, rings, necklace, earrings, all of it. Phone stays in the locker. If you need entertainment that badly, try this revolutionary technique: sitting quietly with your thoughts. I know, terrifying.

## The Etiquette Violations

Now for the fun part. These won't hurt you, but they will get you silently (or not so silently) judged by everyone around you.

### The FaceTime Caller

Nobody, and I mean NOBODY, wants to be an unwilling extra in your video call. Not the shirtless guy in the corner. Not the woman just trying to decompress after work. And definitely not Kevin from accounting on the other end of your call, who is now seeing way more of the LA Fitness sauna than he ever wanted to.

In Finland, this would get you deported. Actually, in Finland, your phone wouldn't even make it past the changing room before someone gave you a look that made you reconsider your life.

### The Toenail Clipper

Yes. People do this. In public saunas. I've witnessed it. I'm still in therapy.

There's a special level of unselfawareness required to think "you know what this hot, enclosed space with strangers needs? The sound of my nail clippings pinging off the wooden benches."

### The Aggressive Exerciser

The sauna is not your hot yoga studio. It's not the place for your stretching routine, your crunches, or whatever that movement is where you're basically doing jumping jacks while seated.

You're flinging sweat onto everyone around you. You're taking up three people's worth of space. And you're probably not even getting a better workout, because heat and exercise both stress your cardiovascular system, and combining them in a small enclosed space is how you end up in the "Dangerous Stuff" section of this article.

### The Thermostat Vigilante

Every gym sauna has one: the person who walks in, immediately judges the temperature to be incorrect, and adjusts it without asking the three people who have been in there for 20 minutes and were perfectly comfortable.

This is a declaration of war. At minimum, you ask. "Hey, mind if I bump this up a bit?" gives people a chance to say "actually, I'm almost done, give me five minutes" or "go for it." Touching the thermostat without consent is how enemies are made.

### The No-Towel Sitter

Public sauna benches are wood. Wood is porous. You are sweating. Connect the dots.

Sitting directly on public sauna benches without a towel underneath you is nasty. There's no nice way to say it. Bring a towel. Sit on it. This is non-negotiable.

## The "I Thought I Was Being Smart" Mistakes

These are the mistakes made by people who've done a little research, but not quite enough.

### Essential Oils Directly on the Rocks

You saw a spa do this once. It smelled amazing. So you bring your little bottle of eucalyptus oil to the gym sauna and pour it right on the heater rocks.

Except some essential oils are flammable. And even the ones that aren't can leave residue that messes with the heater. And concentrated essential oil steam can irritate eyes and lungs, especially for people with allergies or asthma who didn't consent to your aromatherapy experiment.

**The Fix:** If you want steam, use plain water. If the sauna has a designated aromatherapy system, use that. Otherwise, save the essential oils for home.

### Eating a Big Meal Before

Your body can either digest food OR manage extreme heat. Doing both at the same time is asking for nausea at best and vomiting at worst.

**The Fix:** Eat at least 1-2 hours before your sauna session. Light meals are better than heavy ones. You want your blood available for circulation and cooling, not tied up in your digestive system.

### Cold Drinks During (Wait for After)

It seems logical: you're hot, drink something cold to cool down. But here's the thing: that ice water makes your body think it needs to heat up even more to counteract the cold. It actually makes the experience more uncomfortable.

**The Fix:** Hydrate before. Hydrate after. During the sauna, just let your body do its thing. The cold water will be much more satisfying once you're done.

### Expecting Miracles

"I lost 5 pounds in one sauna session!" Cool story. You lost 5 pounds of water. You'll gain it back the moment you drink a glass of water. Which you should, immediately.

"I'm detoxing!" Your liver and kidneys do the detoxing. Sweat is 99% water and salt. That remaining 1% includes trace minerals and tiny amounts of other substances, but nothing that constitutes meaningful "detoxification."

"More time equals more benefits!" The research shows diminishing returns after about 15-20 minutes. The cardiovascular benefits, the heat shock protein activation, the relaxation response, they don't scale linearly with time. But the risks do.

**The Fix:** Use the sauna for what it's actually good for: cardiovascular conditioning, stress relief, muscle relaxation, and that post-sauna glow. Those benefits are real and documented. The miracle claims aren't.

## What to Do Instead: The Proper Protocol

Here's the simple version of how to sauna correctly:

**Before:**
- Hydrate well throughout the day (not just right before)
- Eat at least 1-2 hours prior
- Remove all jewelry and electronics
- Take a quick shower

**During:**
- Start with 10-15 minutes at moderate temperature (160-175F)
- Sit on a towel
- Listen to your body
- Leave immediately if you feel dizzy, nauseous, or "off"
- If you want longer exposure, take breaks rather than pushing through

**After:**
- Cool down gradually (don't immediately blast yourself with ice water unless you're doing intentional contrast therapy)
- Rehydrate with water or an electrolyte drink
- Shower off the sweat
- Wait at least an hour before alcohol
- Don't drive if you're feeling lightheaded

## The 5-Minute Sauna Checklist

Print this. Put it in your gym bag. Thank me later.

Before entering:
- [ ] Hydrated today? (Not just now, throughout the day)
- [ ] Shower taken?
- [ ] Jewelry off?
- [ ] Phone in locker?
- [ ] Towel to sit on?
- [ ] Any medical conditions that need clearing?
- [ ] Been drinking? (If yes, skip the sauna)

During:
- [ ] Sitting on towel?
- [ ] Keeping to yourself?
- [ ] Checking in with your body?
- [ ] Planning to leave at 15-20 minutes max?

Warning signs to exit immediately:
- [ ] Dizziness
- [ ] Nausea
- [ ] Rapid heartbeat
- [ ] Headache
- [ ] Confusion
- [ ] Muscle cramps

After:
- [ ] Cool down period taken?
- [ ] Water consumed?
- [ ] Feeling stable before driving?

## The Bottom Line

Saunas are incredible tools for health, relaxation, and recovery. The research supporting their benefits for cardiovascular health, stress reduction, and longevity is robust and growing. Finnish people have been using them for thousands of years, and studies show regular sauna users have significantly lower risks of heart disease, dementia, and all-cause mortality.

But like any powerful tool, they demand respect. The difference between a great sauna experience and a dangerous one often comes down to simple awareness: knowing your limits, reading your body's signals, and understanding that more isn't always better.

Most of the mistakes in this article are easily avoided with a little knowledge and a lot of common sense. Now you have both.

See you in the sauna. And if you're the guy FaceTiming in there, I'm going to pretend I didn't see you.
