## Email Body

---

**[PREVIEW TEXT]:** Why heat heals, where to find it, and your first moment of stillness.

---

You just did something most people never do.

You decided that maybe — just maybe — slowing down isn't weakness. That sitting in the heat, doing nothing, might actually be *the point*.

Welcome. You're in the right place.

---

### What happens now

Every **Thursday evening**, you'll get a letter from us. Short. Useful. Worth your time.

Here's what's inside:

🔬 **Why heat heals** — The science. What sauna actually does to your sleep, your stress, your body.

🗺️ **Where to find it** — Beautiful saunas around the world. Places worth the journey.

🧘 **Five minutes of stillness** — A moment of calm. The whole point, really.

That's it. No spam. No selling. Just heat.

---

### One small favor

To make sure our letters actually reach you:

1. **Add us to your contacts** — saunaguide@mail.beehiiv.com
2. **Move this email to Primary** (if it landed in Promotions)
3. **Reply with one word: "Löyly"** — It's Finnish for the steam that rises when water hits hot stones. It also helps our deliverability.

---

### While you wait for Thursday

Here are three things to explore:

→ **[The Science of Heat](/guides/sauna-health-benefits)** — What 20 minutes at 80°C does to your body

→ **[World's Best Saunas](/saunas)** — 40+ places worth the journey

→ **[The Finnish Proverb](/guides/sauna-cultures-around-the-world)** — "The sauna is the poor man's pharmacy"

---

### One last thing

The Finns have been doing this for thousands of years. They have a saying:

> *"In the sauna, one must conduct himself as one would in church."*

We don't take ourselves that seriously. But we do believe there's something sacred about choosing stillness in a world that won't stop screaming for your attention.

You're allowed to slow down. That's what this is about.

See you Thursday.
